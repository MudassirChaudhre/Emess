Our proposal is about the problem of the students and all those people who live in our city Lahore for study and job purposes a common problem which they both face is homemade food we are going to resolve their problem by delivering them homemade food and on the other hand, another huge problem which is as we all know about the unstable businesses and uncertainty in Pakistan in this situation a single man can not run home with a  little income so for their support we offer their housewives make food from home because in our society people consider it as a taboo that women working outside from home so we offer the housewives to make food from home and we sell your food and deliver to those people who are living in hostels and somewhere.
